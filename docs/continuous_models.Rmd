## Linear Models

Modeling commands are very similar between R and Stata. The primary difference is that R argument go inside paranthesis rather than just after the name of the command as in Stata. Stata options come after a comma and are separate from formulae, but all R arguments--including formulae--are treated the same and separated by commas. Default R output is simpler than Stata: use `summary()` if you want Stata-like output. In Stata, you save model output using `estimates store` while in R you just assign the model object to a name. Note we specified which data we are using in R: R can have many data sets loaded at the same time!

<div class="column-left">
#### Stata

```
glm y x z, ///
   family(gaussian) link(identity)
estimates store example_model
```
Note in the above examples, a single Stata command can be spread over multiple lines using `///`.
</div>

<div class="column-right">
#### R

```
example_model <- glm(y ~ x + z,
                     family = gaussian(link = "identity"),
                     data = example_data)
summary(example_model)
```
 In R, all commands can span multiple lines so long as each line (other than the last) ends in an operator (e.g. `,` as above, but also `+` like in `ggplot2` calls).
